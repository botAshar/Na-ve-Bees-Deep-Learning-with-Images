# Na-ve-Bees-Deep-Learning-with-Images #
In this project the images of bees are recognized and Classifying using a deep convolution neural network using Tesorflow Keras module. The following tasks are performed:

* Importing the Data and python Liberaries
* Examining & Visualizing the Training Data
* Splitting the Data for training, testing and validation.
* Applying the Standard Scaler to the Data
* Defining the Keras Module consisting of 10 layers including convolutions, maxpooling, flatten, Dropout and Dense layers
* Training and Testing the module, Using Binaray Crossentropy as loss function
* Loading the Pre-trained model
* Testing and plotting the accuracy and loss.
* Generating Predictions

I also demonstrated how the images are transformed in the different layers of neural network as show below:
